        <h2><span>Chart 1: Relationship Between Tourism Activity & Average Meter Price</span></h2>
        <h4>Purpose: To examine the relationship between tourism occupancy and average meter prices</h4>
        <h4>Insights:</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Prices are widely distributed across all levels of tourism activity.</li>
          <li>No direct linear relationship exists between them.</li>
          <li>Tourism activity is not a primary driver of real estate prices at the overall market level.</li>
          <li>There are other factors play a significant role in determining prices.</li>

        <h4>Purpose: To evaluate how different property types respond to tourism activity</h4>
        <h4>Insights:</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>The general correlation between tourism activity and real estate prices is weak.</li>
          <li>The nature of the property determines the impact of tourism.</li>
          <li>Investment properties such as villas and land are more sensitive to tourism than traditional ones.</li>

        <h4>Purpose: To identify areas where tourism activity most strongly influences specific property categories</h4>
        <h4>Insights:</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Tourism only affects specific areas with special conditions (like proximity to tourist attractions).</li>
          <li>Even in the most affected areas, tourism is not a decisive factor due to the weak correlation.</li>
          <li>We cannot assume that real estate prices will rise directly in tourist areas and they are also influenced by other factors.</li>

        <h2><span>Chart 4: Impact Distribution</span></h2>
        <h4>Purpose: To check the distribution of tourism impact across different areas and property types.</h4>
        <h4>Insights:</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>The general impact of tourism is weak to moderate, meaning it should not be considered as the only or primary driver.</li>
          <li>There is only a very small proportion of areas that are primarily tourism driven, and these are typically close to huge attractions (mainly Burj Khalifa and Dubai Mall).</li>
          <li>Some areas show a negative impact from tourism, possibly due to associated factors such as noise and congestion.</li>
          <li>Tourism in Dubai has a general impact on property prices but this impact is limited to specific geographical areas and conditions, and to certain types of properties.</li>

        <h4>Purpose: To rank the areas based on a composite index of tourism growth, price stability, liquidity, and price attractiveness.</h4>
        <h4>Insights:</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>The ranking is based on a composite index that combines five factors not just the meter price.</li>
          <li>An area may be considered expensive due to existence of multiple factors such as liquidity and stability.</li>
          <li>An area that may be not expensive is considered underdeveloped due to weak tourism growth.</li>
          <li>A cautious investor seeks high price stability and a risk taking investor seeks strong tourism growth. (Tourism is not the main factor as we mentioned)</li>

        <ul>
          <li>The majority of areas are considered in the Weak category.</li>
          <li>Excellent and very good areas represent a very small percentage only.</li>
          <li>There are few outstanding areas and high competition for them.</li>

        <h4>Insights:</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>The idea that "higher price means better investment" is wrong.</li>
          <li>High-priced areas rarely achieve more than 30 points on the index.</li>
          <li>The best investment opportunities are concentrated in the 8,000-18,000 meter range.</li>
          <li>Strong tourism growth is concentrated in middle priced areas (not luxury areas). </li>

        <h4>Purpose: Understanding seasonal price behavior for multiple years</h4>
        <h4>Insights:</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Prices follow a clear seasonal pattern repeating consistently during multiple years.</li>
          <li>Relative price increases occur during October to March.</li>
          <li>Lowest price levels are between June and September.</li>
          <li>Price differences between peak and low seasons reach 8-12% per square meter.</li>

        <h2><span>Chart 2: Best Months to Buy</span></h2>
        <h4>Purpose: Determining optimal months to buy using a composite index</h4>
        <h4>Insights:</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>The Buy Score index combines four factors: average price, price volatility, transaction volume, and tourism activity.</li>
          <li>Summer months show low Buy Scores due to: reduced purchase demand, lower tourism activity, stable prices, and less buy competition.</li>
          <li>Winter months show high Buy Scores due to: increased local/international demand, higher transaction size, price increases and volatility.</li>
          <li>The ranking aligns perfectly with Monthly Price Trends chart which confirm our index reliability.</li>
          <li>This analysis proves the market does not offer equal opportunities all the year and timing is a critical investment factor.</li>

        <h4>Purpose: To compare between summer and winter price averages</h4>
        <h4>Insights:</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Average prices in summer are lower than winter averages.</li>
          <li>Summer offers relative advantages like lower prices, greater negotiation flexibility, and avoidance of peak price risk.</li>
          <li>The seasonal comparison is a decision support tool for purchase timing.</li>

        <ul>
          <li>High risk areas are limited in number but clear.</li>
          <li>The mentioned areas suffer from multiple factors at the same time.</li>
          <li>Key risk dimensions are price volatility, lagged tourism sensitivity, low liquidity, and above the average pricing.</li>
          <li>These areas face higher probability of sudden price corrections.</li>

        <h4>Purpose: To measure and distinguish how much area prices respond to tourism changes after a period of time</h4>
        <h4>Insights:</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Tourism impact on prices is not immediate but it appears with a time lag (3 months) in sensitive areas.</li>
          <li>Most areas show weak to moderate correlation with lagged tourism activity.</li>
          <li>Some high price areas show clear sensitivity to tourism changes.</li>
          <li>Other high price areas have limited tourism dependence showing price stability.</li>
          <li>Low correlation areas rely on residential or long term demand and offers greater stability.</li>

        <h4>Insights:</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Areas are classified into four categories: Very Stable, Stable, Moderate, and Volatile.</li>
          <li>Very Stable areas are a minority and the market is not stable in general.</li>
          <li>A significant part of the market is in Moderate to Volatile categories.</li>
          <li>Higher returns are often associated with higher volatility and risk.</li>
